# Roadmap to Becoming Proficient in Web Bug Bounty Hunting

## 1. Foundational Knowledge  
Start with understanding the basics of how the web works and the technologies behind it.  

### Key Areas to Learn:  

#### Web Fundamentals:  
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols (status codes, headers, cookies, and sessions).  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.  
- Web application components (frontend, backend, databases, APIs).  

#### Networking Basics:  
- TCP/IP, DNS, and how web servers function.  
- Understanding ports and protocols.  

#### Web Application Architecture:  
- Client-server architecture.  
- Common frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Flask, Laravel).  
- RESTful APIs and microservices.  

### Resources:  
- **Books**: *"HTTP: The Definitive Guide"* by David Gourley.  
- **Courses**:  
  - FreeCodeCamp (web development basics).  
  - Networking basics on Cisco NetAcad.

## 2. Learning Resources  
Gather high-quality learning materials to understand web security and bug hunting.  

### Key Resources:  

#### Books:  
- *"The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"* by Dafydd Stuttard.  
- *"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation"* by Jon Erickson.  

#### Courses & Tutorials:  
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy (Free).  
- TryHackMe's "Web Fundamentals" and "OWASP Top 10".  
- PentesterLab (paid).  

#### Recommended Tools:  
- **Burp Suite**: For scanning and intercepting HTTP traffic.  
- **OWASP ZAP**: Free vulnerability scanner.  
- **Nmap**: Network mapping and reconnaissance.  
- **ffuf**: Fuzzing tool for discovering hidden directories and parameters.  
- **Dirb/Gobuster**: Directory brute-forcing tools.

## 3. Hands-On Practice  
Practice is critical for bug bounty hunting proficiency.  

### Beginner-Friendly Platforms:  
- **Hack The Box (HTB)**: For solving real-world web challenges.  
- **TryHackMe**: Interactive lessons with guided challenges (start with OWASP Top 10).  
- **PortSwigger Academy**: Free labs on web vulnerabilities.  

### How to Practice:  
- Analyze and replicate real-world examples of vulnerabilities.  
- Use intentionally vulnerable applications like:  
  - DVWA (*Damn Vulnerable Web Application*).  
  - Juice Shop (*OWASP project*).  
  - WebGoat (*OWASP project*).

## 4. Common Vulnerabilities  
Focus on mastering the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and others.  

### Key Vulnerabilities to Master:  

#### Injection Attacks:  
- SQL Injection (SQLi), NoSQL Injection.  
- Command Injection.  

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  
- Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS.  

#### Others:  
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).  
- Broken Authentication & Session Management.  
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).  

### Hands-On Examples:  
- Replicate vulnerabilities on platforms like PortSwigger, DVWA, and HTB.  
- Learn the mitigation techniques for each vulnerability.

## 5. Developing Expertise  
Advance your skill set by exploring complex vulnerabilities and techniques.  

### Advanced Techniques:  
- Exploiting logic flaws and bypassing access controls.  
- Bug chaining (combining smaller issues for bigger impact).  
- Client-side security: tampering with JavaScript and browser extensions.  
- API testing and exploiting.  

### Key Skills to Build:  
- Reverse engineering applications.  
- Writing custom proof-of-concept (PoC) scripts (using Python, Bash).  
- Effective bug reporting with clear PoCs and remediation steps.  

### Advanced Resources:  
- *"Real-World Bug Hunting"* by Peter Yaworski.  
- Explore advanced labs on PentesterLab and CTF challenges.

## 6. Staying Updated  
Stay informed about the latest trends, tools, and techniques in web security.  

### How to Stay Updated:  

#### Follow Security Blogs & Researchers:  
- Blogs like Google Project Zero, HackerOne, Bugcrowd.  
- Twitter accounts of top security researchers.  

#### Participate in Communities:  
- Forums like Reddit’s r/bugbounty, Null Byte, and HackerOne’s Discord.  
- Attend webinars and conferences (e.g., Black Hat, DefCon, OWASP events).  

#### Bug Bounty Platforms:  
- Sign up on platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and Synack.  
- Start hunting on public programs.  

**Networking Tip:** Engage in write-ups and share your findings to build a reputation in the community.

## Estimated Timeline  
- **0-3 Months**: Master foundational knowledge and learn basic vulnerabilities.  
- **3-6 Months**: Begin hands-on practice and solve beginner-level challenges.  
- **6-12 Months**: Focus on intermediate vulnerabilities and start hunting bugs.  
- **1-2 Years**: Develop advanced skills and participate in complex programs.
